All the features provided have predictable\r\nabstractions and join together coherently.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// This example will demux and decode an Opus-containing OGG file, and then write it to a file.\r\nconst prism = require('prism-media');\r\nconst fs = require('fs');\r\n\r\nfs.createReadStream('./audio.ogg')\r\n  .pipe(new prism.opus.OggDemuxer())\r\n  .pipe(new prism.opus.Decoder({ rate: 48000, channels: 2, frameSize: 960 }))\r\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('./audio.pcm'));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example above can work with either a native or pure JavaScript Opus decoder - you don't need to worry about changing\r\nyour code for whichever you install.\r\n\r\n- FFmpeg support (either through npm modules or a normal installation) \r\n- Opus support (native or pure JavaScript)\r\n- Demuxing for WebM/OGG files (no modules required!)\r\n- Volume Altering (no modules required!)\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nThe following dependencies are all optional, and you should only install one from each category (the first listed in\r\neach category is preferred)\r\n\r\n- Opus\r\n  - [`node-opus`](https://github.com/Rantanen/node-opus) (native, ^0.3.1)\r\n  - [`opusscript`](https://github.com/abalabahaha/opusscript) (^0.0.6)\r\n- FFmpeg\r\n  - [`ffmpeg-static`](http://npmjs.com/ffmpeg-static) (^2.4.0)\r\n  - `ffmpeg` from a [normal installation](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)\r\n\r\n## Useful Links\r\n\r\n- [Documentation](https://hydrabolt.me/prism-media)\r\n- [Examples](https://github.com/amishshah/prism-media/tree/master/examples)\r\n- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/discordjs)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n> Copyright 2019 Amish Shah\r\n> \r\n> Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n> you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n> You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n> \r\n>    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n> \r\n> Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n> distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n> WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n> See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n> limitations under the License.",
